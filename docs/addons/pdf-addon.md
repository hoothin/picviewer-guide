# PDF Addon

The PDF addon replaces ZIP packing with PDF digital album generation.
Suitable for batch organizing image collections.

## Download Link

## How to Use

1. Install the PDF addon script.
2. Enable "Compress to ZIP" in the gallery.
3. It will generate a PDF file directly upon export.

## Typical Scenario

When website images are numbered sequentially, you can batch add them in the gallery and export as PDF.
For example `1.jpg` to `99.jpg`.

## Notes

- The addon depends on `jsPDF`, it may take a moment to load on first use.
- The PDF generation process inserts images one by one; for large volumes, batch processing is recommended.
