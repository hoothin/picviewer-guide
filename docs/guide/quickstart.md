## 2. Open Gallery

Press `Ctrl + G` to quickly enter Gallery Mode. The gallery automatically collects recognizable images on the current page and provides filtering, sorting, and download functions.

## 3. Quick Preview

Hold `Ctrl` and hover over an image or link to directly preview the large image. If the target site is heavy, it is recommended to enable wait for image load to improve stability.

## 4. Batch Download

In the gallery, you can choose to:

- Export as ZIP

- Send to aria2

## 5. Rule Adaptation

If you encounter thumbnails or lazy loading preventing original image retrieval, please add or enable rules. The rule system supports URL replacement, inner page fetching, and custom script logic.
