# Shortcuts & Gestures

## Float Bar Shortcuts

Default shortcuts are only active when the float bar appears. You can enable or modify them in settings.

| Function | Default Key |
| --- | --- |
| Open Original | `A` |
| Search Original | `S` |
| Open Current | `C` |
| Magnifier | `M` |
| Gallery | `G` |
| Download | `D` |

## Global Preview Key

`Ctrl` preview mode is enabled by default:

- Hold `Ctrl` and hover over an image or link to directly preview the large image.
- Release to close preview automatically (can be configured to persist).

## Usage Tips

- If you prefer using the keyboard, enable "Global Shortcuts" to quickly access float bar functions.
- Gallery mode supports mouse wheel zoom and arrow key navigation (depends on site and browser settings).
