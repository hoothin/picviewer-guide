# What is it?

Picviewer CE+ is a universal enhancement script for web images, aiming to make the process of "viewing, selecting, collecting, and exporting" as fast as possible.

It consists of three parts working together:

- **Main Script**: Handles the float bar, preview, gallery, download, and global interactions.
- **Rule System**: Determines "how to turn a thumbnail into the original image", compatible with lazy loading, inner page fetching, and special sites.
- **Extensions**: Blank gallery page and PDF addon, covering batch organization and digital albums.

## How it Works

1. When you hover over an image or recognizable element, the script tries to match rules and infer the real image URL.
2. Upon success, the float bar appears, allowing preview, magnifier, gallery mode, or download.
3. In Gallery mode, you can batch filter, sort, export, and collect across pages.

## Use Cases

- Websites where you need to quickly view original or large images.
- Gallery sites with lazy loading or pagination.
- Batch downloading, organizing, renaming, and format conversion.
- Search by image or multi-engine comparison.
